To get started, intitalize your Yamaha 01V in 03D mode.
Then, add the following paramaters:
* CC 13 -> Fader -> Channel -> 15-16
* CC 14 -> On -> Channel -> 15-16
* CC 15 -> Pan -> Channel -> 15
* CC 16 -> Pan -> Channel -> 16
* CC 50 -> On -> Master -> Bus 1
* CC 51 -> On -> Master -> Bus 2
* CC 52 -> On -> Master -> Bus 3
* CC 53 -> On -> Master -> Bus 4

Simply run `npm start` and a window will display allowing you to choose your Midi devices and web server port.

You will then be given a URL for remote access as well as an option to open the desktop controller.

01V Web Controller works on touch screens and works best as a mobile web app for phones, simply open the url, and add the shortcut to your home screen.

Tip: To easily reset pan pots to the default value, click on the channel name while on the pan page.
